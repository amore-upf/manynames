# ManyNames
Repository for the ManyNames dataset (version 2.2) for English and Mandarin Chinese. The English version of ManyNames provides ca. 36 name annotations for each of 25K objects in images selected from VisualGenome, whereas the Chinese version provides approximately 20 name annotations for 1319 objects in images selected from ManyNames. For an illustration see the image below.

For details about the data collection and the information in the dataset, see [Silberer, Zarrieß, & Boleda, 2020](https://aclanthology.org/2020.lrec-1.710/) (version 1.0) and [Silberer, Zarrieß, Westera, & Boleda, 2020](https://aclanthology.org/2020.coling-main.172/) (version 2.0), and [He, Liao, Liang, & Boleda, 2023](https://aclanthology.org/2023.conll-1.30/) (Mandarin Chinese version). For changes in the present version see the [release notes](https://github.com/amore-upf/manynames/blob/master/release_notes_v2.2.md). Previous versions of the dataset can be accessed as older releases in this repository.


## Data files
The data are provided in two formats:

* **TSV**: tab-separated text files, first row contains the column labels, nested data is stored as python dictionaries (i.e., "{key: value}"). Available in this folder.
* **JSON**: the same data set in .json format to facilitate access (to the nested data) outside of python. Included in subfolder *other_data*.

The columns that are included for **both the English and Mandarin Chinese datasets** are labelled as follows.

| Column | Type | Description |
| -------- | :-------: | -------- |
| vg_object_id | int | The VisualGenome id of the object (functions as the unique id for the datapoints in ManyNames)|
| vg_image_id | int | The VisualGenome id of the image |
| topname | str | The most frequent name produced by subjects for the object |
| responses | dict | Correct responses and their counts |
| domain | str | The ManyNames domain of the object, i.e. categorisation of objects into *people*, *animals_plants*, *vehicles*, *food*, *home*, *buildings*, and *clothing* |
| N | int | The number of name types in the ManyNames responses (each name counts once) |
| total_responses | int | Sum count of correct responses (tokens; each subject production of a name counts once)|
| perc_top | float | The relative frequency of the topname (among correct responses), in percentage|
| H | float | The H agreement measure from Snodgrass and Vanderwart (1980), which is the entropy over subject responses |
| vg_synset | str | The WordNet synset of the object, as provided by VisualGenome  |
| link_mn | str | The url to the image with the object marked|
| bbox_xywh | list| The coordinates of the object: "[left x, bottom y, width, height]"; y=0 is at the top of the image|

&nbsp;

The **English** dataset also includes the columns listed below.

| Column | Type | Description |
| -------- | :-------: | -------- |
| incorrect | dict | Incorrect responses and their counts |
| split | str | Use of the image in training vs. test vs. validation in [Silberer, Zarrieß, Westera, & Boleda, 2020](https://aclanthology.org/2020.coling-main.172/) |


&nbsp;

The **Mandarin Chinese** dataset also includes the following columns.

| Column | Type | Description |
| -------- | :-------: | -------- |
|  list  |  str | Lists of images assigned to participants |
| familiarity | float | Familiarity approximated as the weighted average of the frequency of the responses in a textual corpus |

*Note*: A subset of the ManyNames data has also been annotated for Catalan within the [AINA project](https://projecteaina.cat/). It is available [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/projecte-aina/cat_manynames).

## Subfolder: other-data/

Contains the ManyNames datasets in JSON format, a file with additional information about the ManyNames objects, and files with lexical information (concreteness, familiarity, imageability, age of acquisition and frequency per million tokens) for each name in ManyNames, for both languages. See the README inside the folder for more information.

## Subfolder: scripts/

Contains scripts to facilitate processing ManyNames and to reproduce tables and figures from publications about ManyNames. See the README inside the folder for more information.
