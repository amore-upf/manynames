# **Other data**
This subfolder contains the datasets in JSON, as well a a file with additional columns for English (*additional-info-en.tsv*) and TSV files with lexical information (concreteness, familiarity, imageability, age of acquisition and frequency per million tokens) of each name in the ManyNames datasets. Lexical information has been retrieved from several datasets included below.
